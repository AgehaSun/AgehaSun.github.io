                        The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the

                        (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to document it. This means that
                        cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript
                        features have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles
                        may use some of those new features. Most of the
                        time, this happens between the stages 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially
                        published.

                        syntax, semantics, and use.
